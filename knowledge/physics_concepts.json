This is also known as the law of inertia. Real-world examples include how seat belts work in cars, or how a ball keeps rolling until friction eventually stops it.",

This means that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. For example, it takes more force to push a heavy shopping cart than a light one with the same acceleration.",

When one object exerts a force on another object, the second object exerts an equal force in the opposite direction on the first object. Examples include a rocket pushing exhaust gases downward while the gases push the rocket upward, or how a swimmer pushes water backward to move forward.",
